# Retail_Sales_and_Profit
Analysed 500K+ records in SQL/Python to uncover top  products, seasonal patterns; built Power BI dashboard that informed Â£15% revenue growth  strategies. 

The initial data cleaning has been done in Python. 
1. check for null values
2. ideally the column names have to be in lowercase and no spaces, "underscore"
3. deriving the discount value from the percentage given
4. derived sale_price
5. derived profit
6. dropped the unnecessary columns

Once done in Python I have analyzed the data set in Python and SQL. 
I have added 2 seperate files, 
1. dataAnalysis (Python)
2. dataAnalysisSQL (SQL)

In the analysis, I have solved the following questions below. 
Followed by the questions, I have also done the graphical Visualization of the solution using Gestalt's Principle.

1. find top 10 highest revenue genrating products
2. find top 5 highest selling products in  each region
3. month over month growth comparisn for sales for year : jan 2022 and jan 2023
4. For each category which month had highest sale?
5. which subcategory had the highest growth by profit in 2023 compared to 2022?
